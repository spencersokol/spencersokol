A few years ago I quit my job in a software consulting firm. I wasn't sure what to do next, but I was guided by voices of family and friends to become a teacher. And I was fortunate enough to find an instructor position for a software development boot camp a couple months later. I enjoyed being a teacher, and I was pretty good at it, if you are to believe my students and progress reports.But all good things must end, and I was laid off in May of this year.

Those few years ago, I had made the decision to change careers. Now it seems that decision is being made for me. There are far too few instructor positions, and it seems also too few software development positions. I wonder if I am being forced into a career change against my will. And so I have to start putting one foot in front of the other in some other direction, without knowing where it's going to lead.

Unfortunately, I cannot walk in the direction I wish. Capitalism requires that I "earn a living", because I do not deserve to live unless I can labor in a manner in which the system finds valuable. And the system does not find teaching valuable. Nor does it find music valuable. Nor writing. Nor taking care of family and friends.

Yet we still have to find some way to provide while making the time to be creative. One way to make that time is to be less of a consumer and to be more descerning about what it is we consume. I find myself consuming more books as of late, in place of visual media. 

Music.

Practice.

Write.
