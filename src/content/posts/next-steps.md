A few years ago I quit my job in a software consulting firm. I wasn't sure what to do next, but I was guided by voices of family and friends to become a teacher. And I was fortunate enough to find an instructor position for a software development boot camp a couple months later. I enjoyed being a teacher, and I was pretty good at it, if you are to believe my students and progress reports. But all good things must end, and I was laid off in May of this year.

Those few years ago, I had been the one to make the decision to change careers. Now it seems that decision is being made for me. There are far too few instructor positions, and it seems also too few software development positions. I wonder if I am being forced into a career change against my will. And so I have to start putting one foot in front of the other in some other direction, without knowing where it's going to lead.

Unfortunately, I cannot walk in the direction I wish. Capitalism requires that I "earn a living", because we do not deserve to live unless we can labor in a manner in which the system&mdash;not its people&mdash;finds valuable. And the system does not find teaching valuable. Nor does it find music valuable. Nor writing. Nor taking care of family and friends.

I'm trying to take next steps, but those next steps in this current system seem to only lead in circles, and I need to find a new path.
