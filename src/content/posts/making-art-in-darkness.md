I think it's an entirely fair assessment to say that the American way of life is dying. Our obsession with individualism and exceptionalism has proved rotten, and it has corrupted many of us, perhaps beyond redemption. And yet, we still have to muddle through our daily lives, buying groceries, paying bills, and trying desperately not to flip off those who still do not understand how fucking roundabouts work. Jesus.

It's easy to fall victim to helplessness in the face of such absolute cruelty. That is by design. The system is manufactured to be anti-communityâ€”and arguably anti-humanity. I can sit here and process this logically and understand it as I write these words, but in my daily life just trying to survive, I often succumb to those feelings of uselessness. Of not being able to see further than earning enough for the next cycle. And it weighs on you. And me.

> I'm just one shitty person. I can't actually change anything.

That feeling right there is bullshit, and it stems from the same exceptional individualist propaganda we've been fed our entire lives. The idea that, if you can't make a big impact, your individual impact is *worthless*. 

But I'm try to remember that everyone has a role (job is the wrong word). Some roles can be big and have a large impact. Most roles, however, will be small ripples.

I want my role to be making people feel human
