I think it's an entirely fair assessment to say that the American way of life is dying. Our obsession with individualism and exceptionalism has proved rotten, and it has corrupted many of us, perhaps beyond redemption. And yet, we still have to muddle through our daily lives, buying **groceries**, paying **bills**, and trying desperately not to flip off those who still do not understand how fucking roundabouts work. *Jesus*.

It's easy to fall victim to helplessness in the face of such absolute cruelty. That's by design. The system is manufactured to be anti-community—and arguably anti-humanity. I can sit here and process this logically and understand it as I write these words, but in my daily life just trying to survive, I often succumb to those feelings of uselessness. Of not being able to see further than earning enough for the next cycle. And it weighs on me. And probably you too.

> I'm just one shitty person. I can't actually change anything.

That feeling right there is absolute bullshit, and it stems from the same exceptional individualist propaganda we've been fed our entire lives. The idea that, if you can't make a big impact, your individual impact is *worthless*. 

Job is a prominent term in our lexicon, but it's the wrong word to use here. So I'm trying to remember that everyone has a **role**. Some will be like waves, beautifully noticeable. Few will be a tsunami. Most roles, however, will be small ripples, but they will all be meaningful.

And so I try to remind myself what I want my role to be: making people remember to feel human, preferrably through music and song. Because all art is meaningful. Even my art. It won't stop the cruelty, but it can remind myself—*and perhaps others*—that the cruelty forces upon us is not the only part of this life. And that small change *is* still change, even mere ripples in the dark.
