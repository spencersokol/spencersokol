description: Remember when app stores were new and shiny? Everyone wanted an app, even your local waxing spa.

In the early 2010s, mobile apps were all the rage. And an Indiana local business needed a small marketing app to help make a name for themselves. They partnered with a local consulting firm to design a mobile app that included a game that allowed you to earn coupons for their waxing services.

Naturally, the game was about waxing a monkey.

With the art and mechanics of the game already created, I was tasked with building an iOS and Android version of the app. The app was built with the Appcelerator Titanium SDK, which allowed for a single codebase for both applications.

The game itself was similar to the old 80s hit "Simon", where you were to follow the hair removal pattern after it flashes on the screen, and mimick the pattern back. Once you met the preset pattern goal, you get rewarded with a coupon from the salon. The coupon functionality was designed to be manageable outside the app, to streamline the process and not have to resubmit the app to the corresponding app stores.

It was a quirky little game concept, and I enjoyed the challenge of creating *Wax That Monkey!*
