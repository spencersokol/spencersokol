The [Digiop](https://digiop.com), [Industrial Valve](https://indvalve.com/), &amp; [Surface Solutions](https://www.surfacesolutionsusa.com/) websites were beautifully designed by a coworker, and they are information dense. Wordpress was chosen as the CMS for its ease of use and flexibility. From a development standpoint, Advanced Custom Post Types was leveraged to ensure that data entry was kept clean on the back end.

The core of these websites led to a lot of custom code that was turned into a reusable library for future Wordpress sites. It includes numerous custom Gutenburg blocks, custom Wordpress settings, advanced URL rewriting features, and more. While it never fully achieved the level of an internal product during my tenure, the goal was to build an extensive toolset that data entry and designers could leverage to build complex Wordpress sites faster.
