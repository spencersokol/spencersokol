A husband and wife team (something that is near and dear to my heart) thought the area of Broad Ripple, Indiana could use a gaming community. So they set out to build one, and brought Heroâ€™s Emporium into existence.

They had a dream, and we got to be a small part of that by designing and building a website from the ground up that catered to their desire to have a store that focused not just on products, but as a gathering place for gamers.

We were able to base the visuals on a logo they already had designed, and created a site that gave focus to their events and products. We kept costs down by working with the WordPress platform, which also gave the client a system that was easy to learn and use. Functionally, we were looking towards a future where they might like to implement e-commerce, selling products directly from their site, and used Woocommerce to manage their products on the back end.

> We were in the market for a business website and wanted a local web developer. Studio 27 came highly recommended. As most of our customers are media-savvy, we needed something slick and professional-looking that worked equally well on PC, tablet, and phone. Studio 27 delivered a beautiful, easy to navigate site with custom plug-ins that exceeded our expectations and met all our business needs.
