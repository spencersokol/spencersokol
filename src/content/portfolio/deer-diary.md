The early days of the app store were an interesting time. Before there were solid toolkits for multiplatform app development, mobile applications required separate codebases. That was the case for Deer Diary, an app that helped hunters keey track of and manage their hunting session data. 

Written in Objective-C and Java, the iOS and Android apps were functional mirrors. My role with these apps was mostly bug-fixing. But managing seperate codebases was a giant hassle, and unfortunately the app was shut down before it could be ported to a more modern framework.
