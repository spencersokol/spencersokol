The system grew from their newsletter trade, and needed to be modernized for future functionality and ease of use. They had access to their existing database, but the codebase could not be retrieved, so the new system needed to be built from the ground up with all of the existing functionality.\n\nTo do this, we leveraged .Net and Entity Framework with clean architecture. Along with their subject matter experts, we were able to reverse engineer their business needs and build an appropriately layered system. The core is their domain models and services, which implements all the necessary busines logic for the marketplace. A database first approach was used with Entity Framework to implement the needed repository logic, and an API layer with thin controllers rounded out the backend. Dependency injection and data mapping tools kept the coupling between the layers low and allows for future infrastructure changes without the need to rewrite the entire system.\n\nThe user interface was left in a minimal state, but leverages the Vue.js component architecture and state management, which will allow the client to easily update the front-end in the future when their priorities allow.",

They partnered with a local consulting firm to design a mobile app that included a game that allowed you to earn coupons for their waxing services.\n\nNaturally, the game was about waxing a monkey.\n\n![Naked Monkey](/assets/naked-monkey.webp)\n\nWith the art and mechanics of the game already created, I was tasked with building an iOS and Android version of the app. The app was built with the Appcelerator Titanium SDK, which allowed for a single codebase for both applications.\n\nThe game itself was similar to the old 80s hit \"Simon\", where you were to follow the hair removal pattern after it flashes on the screen, and mimick the pattern back. Once you met the preset pattern goal, you get rewarded with a coupon from the salon. The coupon functionality was designed to be manageable outside the app, to streamline the process and not have to resubmit the app to the corresponding app stores.\n\nIt was a quirky little game concept, and I enjoyed the challenge of creating *Wax That Monkey!*",

We kept costs down by working with the WordPress platform, which also gave the client a system that was easy to learn and use. Functionally, we were looking towards a future where they might like to implement e-commerce, selling products directly from their site, and used Woocommerce to manage their products on the back end.\n\n> We were in the market for a business website and wanted a local web developer. Studio 27 came highly recommended. As most of our customers are media-savvy, we needed something slick and professional-looking that worked equally well on PC, tablet, and phone.
